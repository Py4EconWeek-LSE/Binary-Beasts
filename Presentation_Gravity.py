# # The Gravity Model
# ## Binary Beasts

# # Motivation
# ### Literature Review
# ### Gravity Model Literature
# * Head, K and Mayer, T. (2014) Gravity Equations: Workhorse, Toolkit, and Cookbook
#     * Defined a simple gravity model, and then expanded into other, more general models to include bilateral trade
#     
# 
# 

# * Anderson, J and van Wincoop, E. (2001) Gravity with Gravitas: A Solution to the Border Puzzle
#     * Solution to the border problem, shows that basing empirics on theoretically grounded gravity equation affects estimates of impact of national borders on trade

# * Santos Silva, J and S Tenreyro (2006), â€œThe log of gravity ",The Review of Economics and Statistics
#     * OLS estimates in log-lin relationships with heteroskedasticity cannot be interpreted as elasticities without bias, so the solution is to use a pseudo-maximum-likelihood (PML) estimation technique, that can also deal with zero values for the dependent variable

# ### Brexit Literature
# * Dhingra, S. et al (2016) The UK Treasury analysis of 'The long-term economic impact of EU membership and the alternatives'
#     * Critically examines a UK Treasury analysis of the impact of Brexit in 3 different trade agreement scenarios.
#     * Argues the treasury has been too cautious in some of their assumptions, and so have understated some of the impacts of Brexit on GDP.

# # Obstacles
# ## Github
# * As someone who had not used Github before, at first it was slightly confusing
# * However, after using it for this project, I can now see why it is very useful in group projects and using it throughout the project has allowed us to get more comfortable with it
